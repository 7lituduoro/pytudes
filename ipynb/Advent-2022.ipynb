    "- **Reading the Input**, e.g. for Day 1, `in1 = parse(1, ints, sep=paragraph)`. The function `parse` splits the input file for day 1 into records (by default each line is a record, but the `sep` keyword argument can be used to split by paragraph or other separators), and then applies a function (here `ints`, which returns a tuple of all integers in a string) to each record. `parse` prints the first few lines of the input file and the first few records of the parsed result.\n",
